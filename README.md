## About Me

Proactive and solutions-oriented Software Engineer with a deep-seated passion for both individual and collaborative problem solving. As a self-driven learner, I bring a unique blend of software development and real life problem solving skills to the table.

I have applied my skills in the realm of 3D printer programming. My journey has also led me to delve into the world of electrical engineering, with a particular interest in radios.

One of my proudest achievements is building my own portfolio website from scratch, and not stopping at just that â€“ I proceeded to construct a server to host it. My portfolio website is currently being hosted on a Raspberry Pi at my home, utilizing Apache for server management, showcasing my full-stack capabilities, hands-on learning approach, and my ability to manage systems at both the hardware and software levels.

I'm constantly looking forward to opportunities where I can apply my diverse skill set, create user-centered experiences, and leverage the power of code to create transformative solutions to real problems.
