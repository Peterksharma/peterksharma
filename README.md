## About Me

My diverse background—from Eagle Scout leadership to Michelin-trained precision to accessibility advocacy—gives me a unique perspective on technical challenges. I understand that the best solutions combine rigorous system design with deep empathy for the people who depend on them.
**Always building with purpose. Always learning. Always serving.**
